# 调整配置{#configuring-your-platform}



Adobe Campaign v7中的某些主要更改需要特定配置。 在迁移之前或之后，可能需要这些配置。

在迁移期间， **NmsRecipient** 表是根据架构定义重建的。 对此表的SQL结构在Adobe Campaign外所做的任何更改都将丢失。

要检查的元素示例：

* 如果已在 **NmsRecipient** 表格，但您尚未在架构中详细说明该内容，因此不会保存该表格。
* 的 **表空间** 默认情况下，属性会返回其值，即在部署向导中定义的值。
* 如果已将引用视图添加到 **NmsRecipient** 表格，则必须在迁移之前将其删除。


## 迁移之前 {#before-the-migration}

迁移到Adobe Campaign v7时，必须配置以下元素。 在启动 **postupgrade**.

<!--

  * Timezones

  During a migration from a v5.11 platform, you must specify the timezone to use during the postupgrade.

  If you wish to use the "multi timezone" mode, refer to [this section](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#time-zones).

  If you use Oracle as a database, check that the Oracle timezone files have properly been synched between the application server and the database server. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#oracle)

* Security zones

  For security reasons, the Adobe Campaign platform is no longer accessible by default: you must configure the security zones, which requires collecting the user IP addresses before the migration. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#security)

* Syntax

  Some Javascript code may no longer accepted in the v7 version, due to the use of a new interpreter. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#javascript).

  Similarly, a new syntax is introduced in Adobe Campaign v7 to replace the SQLData based syntax. If you use code elements with this syntax, you must adapt them. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#sqldata)

  -->

* 密码

   您必须配置 **管理员** 和 **内部** 密码。 [了解详情](../../migration/using/before-starting-migration.md#user-passwords)

<!--
* Tree structure

  If migrating from a v5.11 platform, you must reorganize the tree structure folders according to Adobe Campaign v6 norms. [Learn more](../../migration/using/configuring-your-platform.md#specific-configurations-in-v5-11).

-->

<!--

* Interaction

  If you are migrating from Campaign v6.02 and using the  **Interaction** module, you must delete all 6.02 schema references that no longer exist in v7. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#interaction)

-->

## 迁移后 {#after-the-migration}

运行后 **postupgrade**，请检查并配置以下元素：

* 镜像页面

   镜像页面个性化块已随v6.x发生更改。此新版本可提高访问这些页面时的安全性。

   如果在消息中使用v5个性化块，则镜像页面显示将失败。 Adobe强烈建议在消息中插入镜像页面时使用新的个性化块。

   但是，作为临时解决方法（以及由于镜像页面仍处于实时状态），您可以通过更改选项返回到旧的个性化块以避免此问题 **[!UICONTROL XtkAcceptOldPasswords]** 将其设置为 **[!UICONTROL 1]**. 这不会影响新v6.x个性化块的使用。

* 语法

   如果遇到与语法相关的任何错误，则在升级后期间必须临时激活 **allowSQLInjent** 选项 **serverConf.xml** 文件，因为这样您就有时间重写代码。 修改代码后，请确保重新激活安全性。

* 冲突

   迁移是通过升级后执行的，冲突可能会显示在报表、表单或Web应用程序中。 这些冲突可以从控制台中解决。

* Tomcat

   如果您自定义了安装文件夹，请确保检查迁移后文件夹是否正确更新。

* 报告

   当前所有现成的报表都使用v6.x渲染引擎。 如果您已将JavaScript代码添加到报表中，则某些元素可能会受到影响。

* Web应用程序

   在升级后，如果在连接到已识别的Web应用程序时遇到任何问题，则必须激活 **allowUserPassword** 和 **sessionTokenOnly** 选项 **serverConf.xml** 文件。 要避免出现任何安全问题，必须在问题解决后重新激活这两个选项。

   根据Web应用程序的类型及其配置，必须执行其他操作以确保它们正常工作。

<!--
  If migrating from a v5.11 platform, additional configurations must be carried out. [Learn more](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#specific-configurations-in-v5-11.md)

* Security zones

  Before starting the server, you must configure the security zones. [Learn more](../../installation/using/security-zones.md) and [see here](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#security)

-->

<!--

* Workflows

  If migrating from a v5.11 platform, you must check the workflows folder. [Learn more](../../migration/using/configuring-your-platform.md#specific-configurations-in-v5-11)

-->

<!--

* Tracking

  If migrating from a v5.11 platform, you must configure the tracking mode. [Learn more](../../migration/using/configuring-your-platform.md#specific-configurations-in-v5-11)

-->

* 互动

   如果您使用 **互动**，则迁移后必须调整任何参数。

<!--

* Dashboards

  If a client error appears, you have to either update your dashboards with the new Adobe Campaign v7 code, or manually copy the following files from the v6.02 instance to the v7 instance:

  ```
  v6.02 files and spaces:
  /usr/local/neolane/nl6/datakit/xtk/eng/css/dropDownMenu.css
  /usr/local/neolane/nl6/datakit/xtk/eng/js/client/dropDownMenu.js
  v6.1 files and spaces:
  /usr/local/neolane/nl6/deprecated/xtk/css/dropDownMenu.css
  /usr/local/neolane/nl6/deprecated/xtk/js/client/dropDownMenu.js  
  ```

-->

<!--

## Specific configurations from a v5.11 to v7{#specific-configurations-in-v5-11}



This section details the additional configuration required when migrating from v5.11. You should also configure the settings detailed in the [General configurations](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md) section.

### Web applications {#web-applications-v5}

The following warning will be displayed automatically during migration:

```
The webApp ids have been modified during the migration process. Please make sure to check your scripts/css for broken compatibility (any client side JavaScript or css dealing directly with another element through its id is impacted). See file 'c:\svn\602\nl\build\ncs\var\upgrade/postupgrade/webAppsMigration_*************.txt' for details about the references that were automatically updated, if any.
```

Some components of web applications, for instance the various formula fields, have @id attributes. These are used in the XML code of web applications and are no longer generated in the same way. They are not visible in the interface and you must not normally use them. However, in some cases, @id attributes may have been used to personalize the rendering of web applications, for instance via a stylesheet or using JavaScript code.

During migration, you **must** check the log file path specified in the warning:

* **The file is not empty**: it contains warnings which concern inconsistencies recorded before migration and which still exist. This can be JavaScript code in a web application which references a non-existent ID. Each error must be checked and corrected.
* **The file is empty**: this means that Adobe Campaign has not detected any issues.

Whether the file is empty or not, you must check that these IDs are not used for configuration elsewhere (and adapt configuration if this is the case).

### Workflows {#workflows}

Since the name of the Adobe Campaign installation directory has changed, some workflows may not work after the migration. If a workflow references the nl5 directory in one of its activities, this will raise an error. Replace this reference with **build**. You can run an SQL query to identify these workflows (PostgreSQL example):

```
SELECT   iWorkflowId, sInternalName, sLabel 
FROM XtkWorkflow 
WHERE mData LIKE '%nl5%';
```

### MySQL {#mysql}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>MySQL is only supported in v7 as the main database engine when migrating from version 6.02 or 5.11 using this engine.

MySQL does not manage timezones by default. To enable timezone management, run the following command:

```
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information, refer to the [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html) page.

If modifications have been made to the database structure, during configuration for example (creating specific indexes, creating SQL views, etc.), certain precautions should be taken when migrating. Indeed, certain modifications can be generated from incompatibilities with the migration procedure. For example, creating SQL views containing **Timestamp** fields are not compatible with the **usetimestamptz** option. We therefore advise you to follow the recommendations below:

1. Before starting the migration, back up the database.
1. Delete SQL changes.
1. Perform the postupgrade
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You must follow the migration steps presented in [this section](../../migration/using/migrating-in-windows-for-adobe-campaign-7.md).
1. Reintegrate SQL changes.

In this example, a **NmcTrackingLogMessages** view had been created and this has a **Timestamp** field named **tslog**. In this case, the migration procedure fails and the following error message appears:

```
2011-10-04 11:57:51.804Z B67B28C0 1 info log Updating table 'NmcTrackingLogMessages'
2011-10-04 11:57:51.804Z B67B28C0 1 error log PostgreSQL error: ERROR: cannot alter type of a column used by a view or rule\nDETAIL: rule _RETURN on view nmctrackinglogmessagesview depends on column "tslog"\n (iRc=-2006)
2011-10-04 11:57:51.804Z B67B28C0 1 error log SQL order 'ALTER TABLE NmcTrackingLogMessages ALTER COLUMN tsLog TYPE TIMESTAMPTZ' was not executed. (iRc=-2006)
```

To make sure the postupgrade works, you must delete the view before the migration and re-create it after the migration while adapting it to the TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE mode.

### Tracking {#tracking}

The tracking formula has been modified. When migrating, the old formula (v5) is replaced by the new one (v7). If you use a personalized formula in Adobe Campaign v5, this configuration has to be adapted in Adobe Campaign v7 (**NmsTracking_ClickFormula** and **NmsTracking_OpenFormula** options).

Web tracking management has also been modified. Once migration to v7 has been carried out, you must start the deployment wizard to finish configuring the web tracking.

  ![](assets/migration_web_tracking.png)

Three modes are available:

* **Session web tracking**: If the **[!UICONTROL Leads]** package has not been installed, this option is selected by default. This option is the most ideal in terms of performance and it allows you to limit the size of the tracking logs.
* **Permanent Web tracking**
* **Anonymous Web Tracking**: If the **[!UICONTROL Leads]** package is installed, this option is selected by default. It is the most resource-consuming option. As above, the **sSourceId** column must be indexed (in the tracking table and the **CrmIncomingLead** table).

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on these three modes, refer to [this section](../../configuration/using/about-web-tracking.md).

### Adobe Campaign v7 tree structure {#campaign-vseven-tree-structure}

During migration, the tree structure is automatically reorganized based on the v7 standards. The new folders are added, the obsolete folders are deleted, and their content is placed in the "To move" folder. All items in this folder must be checked after the migration, and the consultant has to decide to either keep it or delete each one. Items to be kept then have to be moved to the right place.

An option has been added for disabling the automatic migration of the navigation tree. This operation is now manual. Obsolete folders are not deleted and new folders are not added. This option should only be used if the out-of-the-box v5 navigation tree has undergone too many changes. Add the option to the console, before migrating, in the **[!UICONTROL Administration > Options]** node:

* Internal name: NlMigration_KeepFolderStructure
* Data type: Integer
* Value (text): 1

If you use this option, after migration you will have to delete obsolete folders, add the new folders and run all necessary checks.

**List of new folders**:

The following folders need to be added after the migration:

| Internal name | Label | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| nmsAutoObjects | Objects created automatically | - |
| nmsCampaignAdmin | Campaign management | - |
| nmsCampaignMgt | Campaign management | - |
| nmsCampaignRes | Campaign management | - |
| nmsModels | Templates | - |
| nmsOnlineRes | Online | - |
| nmsProduction | Production | - |
| nmsProfilProcess | Processes | - |
| xtkDashboard | Dashboards | - |
| xtkPlatformAdmin | Platform | - |
| nmsLocalOrgUnit | Organizational units | - |
| nmsMRM | MRM | MRM installed |
| nmsOperations | Campaigns | Campaign installed |

**List of obsolete folders**:

The obsolete folders to be deleted after the migration are as follows:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The entire content of the obsolete folders must be checked, and for each item the consultant decides whether to keep or delete it. The items to be kept must be moved to the appropriate place.

| Internal name | Label | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| nmsAdministration | Administration | - |
| nmsDeliveryMgt | Campaign execution | - |
| ncmContent | Content management | Content Manager installed |
| ncmForm | Input form | Content Manager installed |
| ncmImage | Images | Content Manager installed |
| ncmJavascript | JavaScript codes | Content Manager installed |
| ncmJst | JavaScript templates | Content Manager installed |
| ncmParameters | Configuration | Content Manager installed |
| ncmSrcSchema | Data schemas | Content Manager installed |
| ncmStylesheet | XSL style files | Content Manager installed |
| nmsAdminPlan | Administration | Campaign installed |
| nmsResourcePlan | Resources | Campaign installed |
| nmsResourcesModels | Templates | Campaign installed |
| nmsRootPlan | Campaign management | Campaign installed |
| nmsOperator | Marketing operators | MRM installed |


## Specific configurations from v6.02 to v7{#specific-configurations-in-v6-02}



The following section details the additional configuration required when migrating from v6.02. You should also configure the settings detailed in [this page](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md).

### Web applications {#web-applications-v6}

If you are migrating from v6.02, error logs regarding overview-type web applications may appear. Error message examples:

```
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'xtk:entityBackupNew' and Id 'nms:webApp|taskOverview', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...)) or (@id IN ([SQLDATA[select 
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'xtk:formDictionary' and Id 'nms:webApp|lastTasks', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...)) or (@id IN ([SQLDATA[select 
[PU-0006] Entity of type : 'nms:webApp' and Id 'taskOverview', expression '[SQLDATA[' was found : '...@owner-id] IN ([SQLDATA[select iGroupid...'. (iRc=-1)
```

These web applications used SQLData and are not compatible with v7, due to heightened security. These errors will lead to a migration failure.

If you didn't use these web applications, run the following cleanup script and rerun the postupgrade:

```
Nlserver javascript -instance:[instance_name] -file [installation_path]/datakit/xtk/fra/js/removeOldWebApp.js
```

If you have modified these web applications and would like to continue using them in v7, you must activate the **allowSQLInjection** option in your different security zones and re-start the postupgrade. Refer to the [SQLData](../../migration/using/general-configurations.md#sqldata) section for more on this.

### Message Center {#message-center}

After a Message Center control instance migration, you must republish the transactional message templates for them to work.

In v7, the names of transactional message templates on execution instances have changed. They are currently prefixed by the operator name that corresponds to the control instance on which they are created, for example **control1_template1_rt** (where **control1** is the name of the operator). If you have a significant volume of templates, we recommend deleting old templates on control instances.
