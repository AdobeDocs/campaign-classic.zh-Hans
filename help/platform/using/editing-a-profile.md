## General tab {#general-tab}

This screen contains all general data about the selected profile. In particular, it contains the last name, first name, email address, email reception format, etc. It looks like this:

![](assets/s_ncs_user_profile_general_tab.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the **[!UICONTROL No longer contact (by any channel)]** option is selected, this means that the profile is on denylist, i.e. the profile has expressed a wish not to be contacted (for example, by clicking an unsubscription link in a newsletter). They will no longer be targeted by deliveries on any channel (email, direct mail, etc.). For more on this, refer to [this page](../../delivery/using/understanding-quarantine-management.md).

## Contact information tab {#contact-information-tab}

This screen contains the direct mail address of the selected profile. It looks like this:

![](assets/s_ncs_user_profile_details_tab.png)

This screen shows the quality index of the address, as well as how many errors the address contains. This information is used directly by the mail carrier based on the number of errors found during previous deliveries, and is not modifiable manually.

## Other tab {#other-tab}

This screen contains user-defined fields that can be personalized based on requirements. You can also change the names of the fields and define their format, via **[!UICONTROL Field properties...]**, as shown below:

## Subscriptions tab {#subscriptions-tab}

This screen contains the information services to which the profile has subscribed.

![](assets/s_ncs_user_profile_subscript_tab_details.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Detail]** button displays the properties of the selected subscription. The **[!UICONTROL Add]** button is used to add a new subscription manually.

## Deliveries tab {#deliveries-tab}

This screen displays the delivery logs for the selected profile. You can also display the labels, dates, and status of the delivery actions addressed to the profile via all channels.

![](assets/s_ncs_user_profile_delivery_tab.png)

## Tracking tab {#tracking-tab}

This screen lets you view the tracking logs for the selected profile. This information is used to track profile behavior following deliveries.

![](assets/s_ncs_user_profile_tracking_tab.png)

This tab shows the cumulative total of all URLs tracked in deliveries.

The list is configurable, and usually contains: the URL clicked, date and time of click, and the document that contained the URL.
